# checkdeps

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of checkdeps is to allow easily checking the versions of dependencies of a given package 
currently installed on the user's system, and eventually compare them with "reference" 
dependencies stored in a RData file. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lbusett/checkdeps")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(checkdeps)
check_pkg_deps("ggplot2")
## basic example code
```
